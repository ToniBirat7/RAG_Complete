    "## **What is `RetrievalQAChain`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`RetrievalQAChain` is a specialized chain in the LangChain framework designed to facilitate question-answering tasks by leveraging a retrieval-based approach. It combines the capabilities of a language model with a document retrieval system to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Retrieval:** `RetrievalQAChain` integrates with various document retrieval systems (like vector stores or traditional databases) to fetch relevant documents based on the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Understanding:** It uses a language model to understand the context of the retrieved documents and generate coherent answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customizable Prompts:** Users can customize the prompts used to query the language model, allowing for tailored responses based on specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain Integration:** It can be easily integrated with other chains in the LangChain framework, enabling complex workflows that involve multiple steps of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Input:** The user provides a question or query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval:** The chain uses the retrieval system to find documents that are relevant to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Answer Generation:** The retrieved documents are then passed to the language model, which processes the information and generates an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:** The final answer is returned to the user.\n"
