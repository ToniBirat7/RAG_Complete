    "\n",
    "[Documentation](https://academy.weaviate.io/courses/wa050-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Object` is an entity in a vector database like a `row` in a relational database. Each object has the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ID`: A unique identifier for the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Properties`: Key-value pairs that store additional information about the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Vector`: A high-dimensional vector representation of the object, typically generated using embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Notes_Images/Object.png\" alt=\"Weaviate Object\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Collections**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Collection` organizes objects into distinct sets of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each collection includes metadata(configurations), indexes, and an object store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata/configurations**: Define the structure and behavior of the collection, including schema definitions, indexing strategies, and other settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexes**: Facilitate efficient searching and retrieval of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Store**: The actual storage location for the objects within the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Notes_Images/Collection.png\" alt=\"Weaviate Collection\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Vectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector embedding captures the meaning of an object as a series of numbers. This representation enables similarity-based search.\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"embedding model\" transforms your input into vectors. For example, the text `\"You're a wizard, Harry!\"` might become the vector `[0.0134, 0.8723, -0.4532, …, 0.5842]`. This is also called putting an object into a `\"high-dimensional vector space\",` because each vector has many numbers (dimensions), and thus a vector can be thought of as a point in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar concepts produce similar vectors. Vectors for `\"You're a wizard, Harry!\"` and `\"You can do magic, Henry!\"` would be mathematically close to each other. This enables Weaviate to understand they're related even though the exact words differ.\n",

    "`Indexes` in Weaviate are data structures that optimize the retrieval of objects based on their vector representations. They enable efficient similarity searches by organizing and structuring the vector data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Vector Database`, each collection has its own `indexes` that facilitate fast and accurate searches.\n",
