    "`Weaviate` is an open-source vector search engine that allows you to store, index, and search through high-dimensional vector embeddings. It is designed to handle large-scale datasets and provides efficient similarity search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of Weaviate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Search:** Weaviate allows you to perform similarity searches based on vector embeddings, making it suitable for applications like recommendation systems, semantic search, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schema Flexibility:** You can define custom schemas for your data, allowing you to structure and organize your information as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GraphQL API:** Weaviate provides a GraphQL API for querying and managing your data, making it easy to integrate with various applications.\n",
